## **Introduction and Literature Review**

In 2022, there was 1 suicide death every 11 minutes (CDC, 2024). This is a staggering number, and doesn’t even account for the amount of people with serious thoughts or plans of suicide. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health in 2020, 4.9% of adults had serious thoughts of suicide in the past year, while 1.3% had made a suicide plan and 0.5% actually attempted suicide (SAMHSA, 2021). Women are significantly more likely to report past suicide attempts than men (Kelly et al., 2020) and young adults aged 18-25 are the most common group to be experiencing serious thoughts of suicide, plans, or attempts (SAMHSA, 2021; Piscopo & Lipari, 2016). Gay and bisexual men are also 4 times as likely to attempt suicide throughout their lifetime compared to heterosexual men, and lesbian and bisexual women are 2 times as likely to do so compared to heterosexual women. Depression and alcohol or other substance use disorders are also 1.5 times higher risk for lesbian, gay and bisexual people compared to heterosexual people (King et al., 2008). 

Suicidality is often comorbid with many other conditions and in this project, we will focus on its comorbidity with major depressive disorder and substance use disorder and how these differ for sexual minorities compared to heterosexual people. Having both a substance use disorder and major depressive disorder is associated with even greater psychological distress than only having one or the other. People with comorbid MDD and alcohol dependence in the past year are at least 20 times more likely to have suicidal ideation than those without both conditions. (Currie et al., 2005). Similarly, the people with the highest levels of past month alcohol use tend to also have recent suicidal ideation (Kelly et al., 2020). Serious suicidal ideation has also been found to be higher for people who binge drank frequently in the past month, used illicit drugs or alcohol in the past year, had a substance use disorder in the past year, and had a major depressive episode in the past year (Piscopo & Lipari, 2016). Heavy and long-term cannabis consumption has also been shown to be associated with worse suicidal outcomes (Shamabadi et al., 2023). Individuals who are dependent on substances are almost 3 times as likely to have MDD and around 4 times as likely to have suicidal thoughts compared to those who are not dependent on substances (Currie et al., 2005). 

Among people 12 or older in 2020, 10.2% had an alcohol use disorder, 6.6% had at least one illicit drug use disorder and 5.1% had a marijuana use disorder. Having any kind of substance use disorder was highest for young adults aged 18-25. 8.4% of adults also reported having a past year major depressive disorder in 2020, with 6% of adults being severely impaired by a major depressive episode in the past year. Those with a comorbid mental illness and a substance use disorder made up 6.7% of adults in 2020 (SAMHSA, 2021).

## **Research Question**

My main research question for this project is “How does substance use influence mental health outcomes in lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals compared to their non-LGB counterparts?” Since there is no question asking about if respondents are transgender, we will only be focusing on LGB rather than LGBT.

Studies have shown that LGB individuals are more likely to experience depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and suicidality. This research question seeks to understand how these mental health issues might influence behaviors like substance use, which are often used as coping mechanisms. Substance abuse, including alcohol and marijuana, can be both a result of mental health struggles and a contributor to further mental health decline.

Understanding how mental health influences substance use specifically in LGB individuals is essential to uncover whether mental health challenges are more likely to lead to substance use among LGB individuals compared to non-LGB individuals.

## **Hypotheses**

1\. LGB individuals who engage in regular substance use (alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana) in the past month are more likely to have experienced psychological distress in the past month compared to non-LGB individuals.

```



This hypothesis aims to explore the relationship between psychological distress in the past month (IV) and regular substance use in the past month (DV), which is hypothesized to be moderated by sexual orientation. Potential confounding variables that will need to be controlled for during regression are whether or not the respondent has experienced a major depressive episode in the past year, whether or not the respondent has had suicidal thoughts, plans, or attempts in the past year, as well as sex and age.

2\. LGB individuals who engage in regular substance use (alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana) are more likely to report experiencing a past year major depressive episode compared to non-LGB individuals.

This hypothesis aims to explore the relationship between experiencing a major depressive episode in the past year (IV) and regular substance use in the past month (DV), which is hypothesized to be moderated by sexual orientation. Potential confounding variables that will need to be controlled for during regression are whether or not the respondent has experienced psychological distress in the past month, whether or not the respondent has had suicidal thoughts, plans, or attempts in the past year, as well as sex and age.

3.  LGB individuals who have had a substance use disorder in the past year are more likely to have experienced suicidal thoughts, plans, and/or attempts in the past year compared to non-LGB individuals.

This hypothesis aims to explore the relationship between experiencing suicidal thoughts, plans, or attempts in the past year (IV) and having a substance use disorder in the past year (DV), which is hypothesized to be moderated by sexual orientation. Potential confounding variables that will need to be controlled for during regression are whether or not the respondent has experienced a major depressive episode in the past year, whether or not the respondent has experienced psychological distress in the past month, as well as sex and age.

These hypotheses seem to be supported by previous literature in that people who have the poorest health outcomes tend to engage in regular substance use or have a substance use disorder. This project aims to expand on previous literature in the field by adding sexual orientation as a new lens to view these relationships with.

## **Data Cleaning and Descriptive Statistics**

The data found in this project is from the [2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/nsduh-national-survey-drug-use-and-health/datafiles). This survey measures substance use, mental illness, and treatment in the civilian non-institutionalized population aged 12 or older. For the purposes of this project, however, I will only be focusing on adults. First, I will be cleaning the data and then I’ll introduce all the variables I plan to use in this project, along with a brief description of how the corresponding data looks in terms of descriptive statistics.

### **Data Cleaning**

First, we need to read in the data and keep only certain columns of interest. We will also rename the columns to make them more readable/understandable.



```{r}
path = file.path("~/GitHub/Effects/original_nsduh_data/NSDUH_2023.sav")

df = read_sav(path, col_select = c(CATAG6, IRSEX, ALCDAYS, MJDAY30A, IRPYUD5ALC, IRPYUD5MRJ, SPDPSTMON, ADSUITPAYR, AMDEYR, SEXIDENT22))

colnames(df) <- c('sex_orient', 'sex', 'age', 'alc30use', 'mj30use', 'alcdisorder_year', 'mjdisorder_year', 'psych_distress_30', 'suicide', 'majordepressive_year')

head(df)
```



Next, we will remove any observations from children since we want to focus on adults. We will also remove observations where people responded “don’t know”, “refused”, or left the answer blank. This will be done by going through each individual column and removing observations corresponding with certain values.



```{r}
#sex_orient
#responses with 6, 85, 94, 97, ad 98 will be removed
new_df <- subset(df, !(sex_orient %in% c(6, 85, 94, 97, 98)))

new_df %>%   
  group_by(sex_orient) %>%   
  summarise(frequency = n()) %>%   arrange(desc(frequency))  
```

```{r}
#sex
df %>%   
  group_by(sex) %>%   
  summarise(frequency = n()) %>%   arrange(desc(frequency))  
```

```{r}
#age
#responses with 1 will be removed to remove minors from dataset
new_df <- subset(df, age != 1)

new_df %>%   
  group_by(age) %>%   
  summarise(frequency = n()) %>%   arrange(desc(frequency))  
```

```{r}
#alc30use
#responses with 85, 94, 97, and 98 will be removed
new_df <- subset(new_df, !(alc30use %in% c(85, 94, 97, 98)))

#responses with 91 and 93 will be changed to 0
new_df$alc30use[new_df$alc30use == 91] <- 0
new_df$alc30use[new_df$alc30use == 93] <- 0

new_df %>%   
  group_by(alc30use) %>%   
  summarise(frequency = n()) %>%   arrange(desc(frequency))
```

```{r}
#mj30use
#responses with 94, 97, and 98 will be removed
new_df <- subset(new_df, !(mj30use %in% c(94, 97, 98)))

#responses with 91 and 93 will be changed to 0
new_df$mj30use[new_df$mj30use == 91] <- 0
new_df$mj30use[new_df$mj30use == 93] <- 0

new_df %>%   
  group_by(mj30use) %>%   
  summarise(frequency = n()) %>%   arrange(desc(frequency))
```

```{r}
#alcdisorder_year
new_df %>%   
  group_by(alcdisorder_year) %>%   
  summarise(frequency = n()) %>%   arrange(desc(frequency))
```

```{r}
#mjdisorder_year
new_df %>%   
  group_by(mjdisorder_year) %>%   
  summarise(frequency = n()) %>%   arrange(desc(frequency))
```

```{r}
#psych_distress_30
new_df %>%   
  group_by(psych_distress_30) %>%   
  summarise(frequency = n()) %>%   arrange(desc(frequency))
```

```{r}
#suicide
#responses with 2 will be changed to 0
new_df$suicide[new_df$suicide == 2] <- 0

new_df %>%   
  group_by(suicide) %>%   
  summarise(frequency = n()) %>%   arrange(desc(frequency))
```

```{r}
#majordepressive_year
#responses with 2 will be changed to 0
new_df$majordepressive_year[new_df$majordepressive_year == 2] <- 0

#responses with NA will be removed
new_df <- new_df %>%
  drop_na(majordepressive_year)

new_df %>%   
  group_by(majordepressive_year) %>%   
  summarise(frequency = n()) %>%   arrange(desc(frequency))
```



Next, I will create new columns with the values of categorical variables for easier plotting later on.



```{r}
#sex_orient2
new_df <- new_df %>% 
  mutate(sex_orient2 = case_when(sex_orient == 1 ~ "Heterosexual",
                                 sex_orient == 2 ~ "Gay/Lesbian",
                                 sex_orient == 3 ~ "Bisexual",
                                 sex_orient == 4 ~ "Other",
                                 sex_orient == 5 ~ "Questioning"))
```

```{r}
#sex_orient3
#change sex_orient to be 0 = non-LGB and 1 = LGB
new_df <- new_df %>% 
  mutate(sex_orient3 = case_when(sex_orient == 1 ~ 0,
                                 sex_orient == 2 ~ 1,
                                 sex_orient == 3 ~ 1,
                                 sex_orient == 4 ~ 1,
                                 sex_orient == 5 ~ 1))
```

```{r}
#there are NA values in our new sex_orient2 column so we will remove those
new_df <- na.omit(new_df)
#all good now!
```

```{r}
#sex_orient4
#if sex_orient3 = 0 ~ non-LGB
#if sex_orient3 = 1 ~ LGB
new_df <- new_df %>%
  mutate(sex_orient4 = case_when(sex_orient3 == 0 ~ "Non-LGB",
                                 sex_orient3 == 1 ~ "LGB"))
```

```{r}
#sex2
new_df <- new_df %>% 
  mutate(sex2 = case_when(sex == 1 ~ "Female",
                          sex == 2 ~ "Male"))
```

```{r}

new_df <- new_df %>% 
  mutate(age2 = case_when(age == 2 ~ "18-25",
                          age == 3 ~ "26-34",
                          age == 4 ~ "35-49",
                          age == 5 ~ "50-64",
                          age == 6 ~ "65+"))
```

```{r}
#alcfreq
new_df <- new_df %>%
  mutate(alcfreq = case_when(alc30use <= 4 ~ '0',
                             alc30use > 4 ~ '1'))
```

```{r}
#alcfreq2
new_df <- new_df %>%
mutate(alcfreq2 = case_when(alcfreq == 0 ~ "Non-Frequent Drinker",
                            alcfreq == 1 ~ "Frequent Drinker"))
```

```{r}
#mjfreq
new_df <- new_df %>%
  mutate(mjfreq = case_when(mj30use <= 4 ~ '0',
                            mj30use > 4 ~ '1'))
```

```{r}
#mjfreq2
new_df <- new_df %>%
  mutate(mjfreq2 = case_when(mjfreq == 0 ~ 'Non-Frequent Marijuana User',
                             mjfreq == 1 ~ 'Frequent Marijuana User'))
```

```{r}
#alcdisorder_year2
new_df <- new_df %>%
  mutate(alcdisorder_year2 = case_when(alcdisorder_year == 0 ~ "No Alcohol Use Disorder",
                                       alcdisorder_year == 1 ~ "Alcohol Use Disorder"))
```

```{r}
#mjdisorder_year2
new_df <- new_df %>%
  mutate(mjdisorder_year2 = case_when(mjdisorder_year == 0 ~ "No Marijuana Use Disorder",
                                      mjdisorder_year == 1 ~ "Marijuana Use Disorder"))
```

```{r}
#psych_distress_30_2
new_df <- new_df %>% 
  mutate(psych_distress_30_2 = 
           case_when(psych_distress_30 == 0 ~ "No",
                     psych_distress_30 == 1 ~ "Yes"))
```

```{r}
#suicide2
new_df <- new_df %>% 
  mutate(suicide2 = case_when(suicide == 0 ~ "No",
                              suicide == 1 ~ "Yes"))
```

```{r}
#majordepressive_year2
new_df <- new_df %>%

           case_when(majordepressive_year == 0 ~ "No",
                     majordepressive_year == 1 ~ "Yes"))
```



Next, I will change the labels for each of the variables for use later on in tables.



```{r}
new_df = apply_labels(new_df,
                      sex_orient = "Sexual Orientation",
                      sex = "Sex",
                      age = "Age Category",
                      alc30use = "# Days Drank Alcohol in Past Month",
                      mj30use = "# Days Used Marijuana in Past Month",
                      alcdisorder_year = "Alcohol Use Disorder",
                      mjdisorder_year = "Marijuana Use Disorder",
                      psych_distress_30 = "Psychological Distress in Past Month",
                      suicide = "Suicidality in Past Year",
                      majordepressive_year = "Major Depressive Episode in Past Year",
                      sex_orient3 = "Sexual Orientation")
```

```{r}
#remove df
rm(df)
```



#### **Saving Cleaned Data as Parquet File**

There were some issues when I tried saving this dataframe as a CSV, so instead I saved it as a Parquet file. After doing so, I used an online converter in order to convert the Parquet file to a CSV for easier analysis in Tableau later on.



```{r}
write_parquet(new_df, "clean_nsduh_data.parquet")
```



### **Descriptive Statistics**

In this section, I will go over all of the variables of interest relating to this project through a brief description of each variable and the possible values as well as some descriptive statistics.



```{r}
dim(new_df)
```



After being cleaned and processed, the new data frame has 24 columns and 40,389 rows.

#### Summary Statistics



```{r, results = "asis"}
tab_df <- new_df %>%
  select(sex_orient2, alc30use, mj30use)

stargazer(as.data.frame(tab_df), type = "html", 
          digits = 2,
          header = FALSE,
          keep = c("alc30use", "mj30use"),
          covariate.labels = c("# Days Drank Alcohol Past Month",
                               "# Days Used Marijuana Past Month"))
```



#### Summary Statistics by Sexual Orientation



```{r}
names(tab_df)[names(tab_df) == "sex_orient2"] <- "Sexual_Orientation"

labs <- c("# Days Drank Alcohol Past Month", "# Days Used Marijuana Past Month")

st(tab_df, group = 'Sexual_Orientation', group.long = TRUE, labels = labs, out = "kable", title = "Summary Statistics by Sexual Orientation")
```



#### Description of Variables

1.  **sex_orient**- sexual orientation of respondent-

    -   Values

        -   1 = Heterosexual

        -   2 = Gay/Lesbian

        -   3 = Bisexual

```



The most common sexual orientation among respondents was heterosexual (85.6%) followed by bisexual (7.5%) and gay/lesbian (3%). The lack of LGB respondents in this project is a severe limitation.

2.  **sex**- sex at birth of respondent -

    -   Values

        -   1 = Female

        -   2 = Male



```{r}
sex_tab <- new_df %>%  
  tabyl(sex2) %>% 
  filter(n != 0) %>% 
  mutate(percent = round(percent * 100, 1), 
         percent = paste0(percent, "%"))  %>% 
  rename(Response = sex2,
         Count = n,
         Percent = percent)

sex<-flextable(sex_tab)

This model shows that individuals who have experienced a major depressive episode in the past year are nearly 8 times as likely to have experienced severe psychological distress in the past month compared to individuals without such a history (p \< 0.05). Individuals who have had suicidal thoughts, plans, and/or attempts in the past year are around 5.5 times more likely to have experienced psychological distress in the past month compared to individuals without a history of suicidality (p \< 0.05).

Men compared to women are around 1.25 times as likely to have experienced severe psychological distress in the past month (p \< 0.05). Older individuals are less likely to experience psychological distress, with each higher age category being associated with around 29% lower odds of severe psychological distress taking place (p \< 0.05). This model shows that, on average, LGB individuals are almost twice as likely to experience psychological distress compared to non-LGB individuals (p \< 0.001).

Frequency of marijuana use (p \< 0.05) is positively associated with psychological distress, with frquent marijuana users being around twice as likely to have experienced recent psychological distress. Frequent alcohol consumption is negatively associated with psychological distress, and those who drink more than 4 drinks a week actually have a slightly lower likelihood of experiencing psychological distress (p \< 0.05).

The predicted probability of experiencing psychological distress using the observed case approach for LGB individuals who are non-frequent drinkers and non-frequent marijuana users is around 0.05 higher than non-LGB individuals with the same patterns of substance use. While this does not sound like a large number, this means that LGB people without frequent alcohol and marijuana use are 55.1% as likely to experience psychological distress compared to their non-LGB counterparts with similar substance use patterns according to our predictions. Our predicted probabilities also show a 37.7% higher likelihood of experiencing psychological distress for LGB people who are frequent drinkers and non-frequent marijuana users compared to non-LGB people with the same substance use patterns. LGB people who use both alcohol and marijuana frequently are also 16.3% more likely than LGB people who do not use alcohol and marijuana frequently to experience psychological distress.

Hypothesis 1 is not supported with these results. The relationships between alcohol use and psychological distress (p \< 0.05), and marijuana use and psychological distress (p \< 0.05) are all weaker for LGB individuals compared to non-LGB individuals. This is likely due to the fact that heterosexual/non-LGB people make up the vast majority of the sample.

### **Model 2**

Hypothesis 2: LGB individuals who engage in regular substance use (alcohol and marijuana) are more likely to report experiencing a past year major depressive episode compared to non-LGB individuals.

This model shows that individuals with suicidality in the past year are 12 times as likely to also have experienced a major depressive episode in the past year. Model 2 shows that older individuals are less likely to experience major depressive episodes, with each higher age category associated with approximately 19% lower odds of a MDE (p \< 0.05). Men compared to women are around 1.68 times as likely to have experienced a MDE in the past year (p \< 0.05).

This model also shows that LGB individuals are around 2.5 times as likely to experience a major depressive episode compared to non-LGB individuals (p \< 0.05).

The frequency of alcohol consumption in the past month is not significantly associated with the likelihood of experiencing MDEs. Despite this, frequent marijuana use (p \< 0.05) is associated with a 1.75 times greater likelihood of having experienced a MDE in the past year.

The predicted probability of experiencing major depressive episodes using the observed case approach for LGB individuals who are non-frequent drinkers and non-frequent marijuana users is around 0.09 higher than non-LGB individuals with the same patterns of substance use. While this does not sound like a large number, this means that LGB people without frequent alcohol and marijuana use are 97.4% as likely to experience a major depressive episode compared to their non-LGB counterparts with similar substance use patterns according to our predictions. Our predicted probabilities also show a 106.3% higher likelihood of experiencing a major depressive episode for LGB people who are frequent drinkers and non-frequent marijuana users compared to non-LGB people with the same substance use patterns. LGB people who use both alcohol and marijuana frequently are also 44.5% more likely to experience a major depressive episode compared to their non-LGB counterparts with the same substance use patterns. The predicted probability plot shown above also depicts LGB people as having a much higher baseline compared to non-LGB people for major depressive episodes regardless of substance use. These predicted probabilities align with pre-existing research showing that LGBT populations tend to struggle more with their mental health than non-LGBT populations.

Hypothesis 2 is not supported by these results. There is no significant difference between LGB and non-LGB individuals in terms of the relationship between alcohol use and a MDE. Marijuana use (p \< 0.05) is also more weakly associated with MDEs for LGB individuals compared to non-LGB individuals. This is likely due to the fact that heterosexual/non-LGB people make up the vast majority of the sample.

### **Model 3**

Hypothesis 3: LGB individuals who have had a substance use disorder (alcohol or marijuana) in the past year are more likely to have experienced suicidal thoughts, plans, and/or attempts in the past year compared to non-LGB individuals.

This model shows that older individuals are significantly less likely to experience suicidal thoughts, plans or attempts, with each higher age category decreasing the risk of suicidality by around 25% (p \< 0.05). Women are around 15% more likely to experience suicidal thoughts, plans or attempts than men (p \< 0.05). This model also shows that LGB individuals are approximately 2.25 times as likely to experience suicidal thoughts, plans or attempts than non-LGB individuals (p \< 0.05). Individuals who have either an alcohol use disorder (p \< 0.05) or a marijuana use disorder (p \< 0.05) are respectively around 1.6 and 1.9 times as likely to also experience suicidal thoughts, plans or attempts.

The predicted probability of experiencing suicidality using the observed case approach for LGB individuals who have no substance use disorders is 89.5% higher than non-LGB individuals without substance use disorders. LGB individuals with both alcohol and marijuana use disorders have a 64.56% higher likelihood of experiencing suicidality compared to their non-LGB counterparts with both substance use disorders. LGB people who have one substance use disorder are around 75% as likely to experience suicidality compared to their non-LGB counterparts with one substance use disorder. LGB people with both an alcohol and a marijuana use disorder are also 104.8% as likely to experience suicidality compared to LGB people without either substance use disorder according to our predictions. The predicted probability plot shown above also depicts LGB people as having a much higher baseline compared to non-LGB people for experiencing suicidal thoughts, plans, and/or attempts regardless of substance use. Similarly to Model 2, these predicted probabilities align with pre-existing research showing that LGBT populations tend to struggle more with their mental health than non-LGBT populations.

Hypothesis 3 is not supported by this model. Individuals with substance use disorders do not significantly differ in their suicidality based on sexual orientation. This is likely due to the fact that heterosexual/non-LGB people make up the vast majority of the sample as has been mentioned in previous models.

## **Diagnostics/Model Evaluation**

Since binary variables are the only types of predictors utilized in these models, we do not need to check for a linearity assumption.

### **Model 1**

#### **Multicollinearity**



```{r}
#check multicollinearity with variance inflation factors (VIF)- should be below 5
vif(mod1)
```



Since the Variance Inflation Factor is between 1 and 5 for each of the predictor variables, there is no multicollinearity detected in Model 1.

#### **Pseudo R-Squared**



```{r}
#McFadden's R^2 - values closer to 1 mean better predictive power
pR2(mod1)
```



A McFadden’s R-squared value of 0.2906 indicates that Model 1 explains about 29.06% of the variation in the outcome variable.

#### **Accuracy**



```{r}
#predict probabilities
pred_probs1 <- predict(mod1, 
                       newdf1 = select(new_df, -psych_distress_30),
                       type = "response")

#convert probabilities to binary outcomes
pred_outcome1 <- ifelse(pred_probs1 > 0.5, 1, 0)

#transform predictions into factor
pred_outcome1 <- factor(pred_outcome1,
                        levels = c(0, 1))

#create confusion matrix
tab1 = table(new_df$psych_distress_30, pred_outcome1,
            dnn = c("observed", "predicted"))

tab1
```

```{r}
#calculate accuracy
(35572 + 1473) / (744 + 3004 + 35572 + 1473)
```



Model 1 has a predictive accuracy of 90.8%.

#### **Sensitivity and Specificity**



```{r}
#sensitivity
sensitivity1 <- tab1[2, 2] / (tab1[2, 2] + tab1[2, 1])

sensitivity1
```

```{r}
#specificity
specificity1 <- tab1[1, 1] / (tab1[1, 1] + tab1[1, 2])

specificity1
```



Model 1 has a higher specificity (98%) than sensitivity (32.9%), which means that it is good at identifying true negatives (those who have not experienced psychological distress) but it might misclassify true positives (those who have experienced psychological distress).

#### **AUC/ROC Curve**



```{r, fig.alt = "A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve graph, showing the performance of Model 1 across different thresholds, with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as a summary metric."}
#the closer the AUC to 1, the better the model fits!
roc1 <- roc(psych_distress_30 ~ fitted(mod1),
            data = new_df)

ggroc(roc1, legacy.axes = TRUE) +
  labs(title = paste0("AUC = ", round(roc1$auc, 2))) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "gray", size = 0.5),
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "gray", size = 0.25)
  )
```



Model 1 has an AUC of 0.85, which indicates that it is fairly reliable and is performing very well in terms of distinguishing between those who have and have not experienced psychological distress in the past month.

### **Model 2**

#### **Multicollinearity**



```{r}
#check multicollinearity with variance inflation factors (VIF)- should be below 5
vif(mod2)
```



Since the Variance Inflation Factor is between 1 and 5 for each of the predictor variables, there is no multicollinearity detected in Model 2.

#### **Pseudo R-Squared**



```{r}
#McFadden's R^2 - values closer to 1 mean better predictive power
pR2(mod2)
```



A McFadden’s R-squared value of 0.1938 indicates that Model 2 explains about 19.38% of the variation in the outcome variable.

#### **Accuracy**



```{r}
#predict probabilities
pred_probs2 <- predict(mod2, 
                       newdf2 = select(new_df, -majordepressive_year),
                       type = "response")

#convert probabilities to binary outcomes
pred_outcome2 <- ifelse(pred_probs2 > 0.5, 1, 0)

#transform predictions into factor
pred_outcome2 <- factor(pred_outcome2,
                        levels = c(0, 1))

#create confusion matrix
tab2 = table(new_df$majordepressive_year, pred_outcome2,
            dnn = c("observed", "predicted"))

tab2
```

```{r}
#calculate accuracy
(35246 + 1316) / (35246 + 3508 + 723 + 1316)
```



Model 2 has a predictive accuracy of 89.6%.

#### **Sensitivity and Specificity**



```{r}
#sensitivity
sensitivity2 <- tab2[2, 2] / (tab2[2, 2] + tab2[2, 1])

sensitivity2
```

```{r}
#specificity
specificity2 <- tab2[1, 1] / (tab2[1, 1] + tab2[1, 2])

specificity2
```



Model 2 has a higher specificity (98%) than sensitivity (27.3%), which means that it is good at identifying true negatives (those who have not experienced a major depressive episode) but it might misclassify true positives (those who have experienced a major depressive episode).

#### **AUC/ROC Curve**



```{r, fig.alt = "A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve graph, showing the performance of Model 2 across different thresholds, with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as a summary metric."}
#the closer the AUC to 1, the better the model fits!
roc2 <- roc(majordepressive_year ~ fitted(mod2),
            data = new_df)

ggroc(roc2, legacy.axes = TRUE) +
  labs(title = paste0("AUC = ", round(roc2$auc, 2))) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "gray", size = 0.5),
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "gray", size = 0.25)
  )
```



Model 2 has an AUC of 0.78, which indicates that it is fairly reliable and is performing well in terms of distinguishing between those who have and have not experienced a major depressive episode in the past year.

### **Model 3**

#### **Multicollinearity**



```{r}
#check multicollinearity with variance inflation factors (VIF)- should be below 5
vif(mod3)
```



Since the Variance Inflation Factor is between 1 and 5 for each of the predictor variables, there is no multicollinearity detected in Model 3.

#### **Pseudo R-Squared**



```{r}
#McFadden's R^2 - values closer to 1 mean better predictive power
pR2(mod3)
```



A McFadden’s R-squared value of 0.2519 indicates that Model 3 explains about 25.19% of the variation in the outcome variable.

#### **Accuracy**



```{r}
#predict probabilities
pred_probs3 <- predict(mod3, 
                       newdf4 = select(new_df, -suicide),
                       type = "response")

#convert probabilities to binary outcomes
pred_outcome3 <- ifelse(pred_probs3 > 0.5, 1, 0)

#transform predictions into factor
pred_outcome3 <- factor(pred_outcome3,
                        levels = c(0, 1))

#create confusion matrix
tab3 = table(new_df$suicide, pred_outcome3,
            dnn = c("observed", "predicted"))

tab3
```

```{r}
#calculate accuracy
(37326 + 541) / (37326 + 2501 + 541 + 425)
```



Model 3 has a predictive accuracy of 92.8%.

#### **Sensitivity and Specificity**



```{r}
#sensitivity
sensitivity3 <- tab3[2, 2] / (tab3[2, 2] + tab3[2, 1])

sensitivity3
```

```{r}
#specificity
specificity3 <- tab3[1, 1] / (tab3[1, 1] + tab3[1, 2])

specificity3
```



Model 3 has a higher specificity (98.9%) than sensitivity (17.8%), which means that it is good at identifying true negatives (those who have not experienced suicidality) but it might misclassify true positives (those who have experienced suicidality).

#### **AUC/ROC Curve**



```{r, fig.alt = "A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve graph, showing the performance of Model 3 across different thresholds, with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as a summary metric."}
#the closer the AUC to 1, the better the model fits!
roc3 <- roc(suicide ~ fitted(mod3),
            data = new_df)

ggroc(roc3, legacy.axes = TRUE) +
  labs(title = paste0("AUC = ", round(roc3$auc, 2))) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "gray", size = 0.5),
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "gray", size = 0.25)
  )
```



Model 3 has an AUC of 0.84, which indicates that it is fairly reliable and is performing very well in terms of distinguishing between those who have and have not experienced suicidality in the past year.

## **Discussion**

Across all three logistic regression models, there were consistent patterns that showed that mental health outcomes such as psychological distress, major depressive episodes (MDEs), and suicidality are all strong associated with demographic factors, mental health history, and substance use patterns. LGB individuals faced significantly higher risks across all mental health outcomes, which is consistent with previous literature in the field.

Model 1 showed that individuals with a major depressive episode reported in the past year were nearly 8 times, and those with suicidal thoughts, plans, and/or attempts were over 5.5 times as likely to report feelings of psychological distress in the past month. Men were slightly more likely than women to report distress, and older individuals were less likely to report feelings of psychological distress, with each age category decreasing the odds by about 29%. LGB individuals were nearly twice as likely to to have experienced psychological distress in the past month. Frequent marijuana use was also positively associated with psychological distress, while alcohol use was inversely related. Despite all this, these substance use relationships were weaker for LGB individuals than non-LGB individuals which did not support Hypothesis 1. Predicted probabilities showed that LGB people who use substances more frequently are more likely than LGB people who don't use substances frequently to experience psychological distress.

Model 2 showed that individuals with a history of suicidality in the past year were 12 times more likely to report a past-year major depressive episode. Older individuals and women had lower odds of experiencing major depressive episodes, while men and LGB individuals had significantly higher odds. Frequent marijuana use was associated with a 75% increase in the likelihood of experiencing a major depressive episode, but frequent alcohol use was not significantly related. The predicted probabilities demonstrated that LGB individuals were at higher risk across all substance use patterns. The association between substance use and major depressive episodes was also weaker for LGB individuals compared to non-LGB individuals, and Hypothesis 2 was not supported.

Model 3 found that older individuals were significantly less likely to experience suicidal thoughts, plans, or attempts with a 25% reduction per age category. Women were significantly more likely than men to experience suicidality. LGB individuals were also found to be twice as likely to experience suicidality compared to non-LGB individuals. Both alcohol and marijuana use disorders significantly increased suicidality risk, but there was no significant difference based on sexual orientation in this association between substance use disorders and suicidality. Predicted probabilities confirmed that LGB individuals, regardless of substance use disorders, faced much higher baseline risks of suicidality compared to non-LGB individuals. Hypothesis 3 was not supported by these results.

## **Conclusion**

The hypotheses surrounding the relationship between substance use (alcohol and marijuana) and mental health outcomes for LGB individuals were not supported. Previous research has shown that there are links between LGBT people and substance use disorders, but that was not the case in this sample. There were some limitations in this study that may have caused this disparity. Since the study predominantly includes non-LGB individuals and LGB individuals only made up around 14.4% of the sample, it may not fully capture the unique mental health challenges faced by sexual minorities. In future research, it might be smart to focus on a sample consisting of equal parts LGBTQ+ and cisgender heterosexual individuals by oversampling LGBTQ+ people. Another issue with this study was that it did not include information on transgender or gender diverse individuals. Future studies should try to include this population in research, since they tend to experience even worse mental health outcomes than the lesbian, gay and bisexual populations due to facing even higher stigma and discrimination (Hajek et al., 2023).
